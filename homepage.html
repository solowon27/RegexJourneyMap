            <p class="subtitle">What are Regular Expressions?</p>
            <article>Regular expression is a group of characters or symbols which is used to find a specific
                pattern from a text.

                A regular expression is a pattern that is matched against a subject string from left to right.
                The word "Regular expression" is a
                mouthful, you will usually find the term abbreviated as "regex" or "regexp". Regular expression
                is used for replacing a text within
                a string, validating form, extract a substring from a string based upon a pattern match, and so
                much more.

                Imagine you are writing an application and you want to set the rules for when a user chooses
                their username. We want to
                allow the username to contain letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens. We also want to limit
                the number of
                characters in username so it does not look ugly. We use the following regular expression to
                validate a username:</article>
                <img src="./Assets/example.png" alt="example">
                <article>Above regular expression can accept the strings <span>john_doe,</span> <span>jo-hn_doe </span><span>and john12_as.</span> It does
                    not match <span>Jo</span> because that string
                    contains uppercase letter and also it is too short.</article>
                <p class="subtitle">Why are Regular Expressions Important in Web Development?</p>
                <article>Regular expressions play a crucial role in web development by enabling developers to
                    validate, extract,
                    and manipulate textual data efficiently. They are used for tasks like form validation, data
                    validation,
                    parsing, and more.</article>
