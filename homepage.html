            <h1 id="section1">What are Regular Expressions?</h1>
            <article>Regular expression is a group of characters or symbols which is used to find a specific
                pattern from a text.

                A regular expression is a pattern that is matched against a subject string from left to right.
                The word "Regular expression" is a
                mouthful, you will usually find the term abbreviated as "regex" or "regexp". Regular expression
                is used for replacing a text within
                a string, validating form, extract a substring from a string based upon a pattern match, and so
                much more.

                Imagine you are writing an application and you want to set the rules for when a user chooses
                their username. We want to
                allow the username to contain letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens. We also want to limit
                the number of
                characters in username so it does not look ugly. We use the following regular expression to
                validate a username:</article>
            <img src="./Assets/regex pattern sample2.jpg" alt="example">
            <article>Above regular expression can accept the strings <span>john_doe,</span> <span>jo-hn_doe
                </span><span>and john12_as.</span> It does
                not match <span>Jo</span> because that string
                contains uppercase letter and also it is too short.</article>
            <p class="subtitle">Why are Regular Expressions Important in Web Development?</p>
            <article>Regular expressions play a crucial role in web development by enabling developers to
                validate, extract,
                and manipulate textual data efficiently. They are used for tasks like form validation, data
                validation,
                parsing, and more.</article>

            <h1 id="section2">Decoding the Strong Password Regex</h1>
            <article>In today's digital age, the security of our online accounts and personal information is
                paramount. One of the fundamental ways to safeguard our online presence is by using strong and
                secure passwords. To enforce the creation of strong passwords, websites and applications often
                employ regular expressions (regex) to define specific criteria that passwords must meet. In this
                article, we will delve into the concept of strong password regex patterns, understanding their
                necessity, exploring common patterns, and defining the criteria for a strong password.</article>

            <p class="subtitle">Understanding the Need for Strong Passwords</p>
            <article>In the realm of cybersecurity, weak passwords are akin to leaving the front door of your
                house wide open. Cyber attackers employ various methods to crack weak passwords and gain
                unauthorized access to accounts. This is where the importance of strong passwords comes into
                play. A strong password is one that is complex, difficult to guess, and resistant to brute-force
                attacks.
            </article>
            <p class="examples"><strong>A week password</strong> most likely to be a word that is in the dictionary, or
                a common word followed by a simple number sequence. like <span>password123</span> or <span>123456</span>
                <strong>A strong password</strong> is one that is complex, difficult to guess, and resistant to
                brute-force attacks. like <span>pass@1word!$*/</span> and so on.
            </p>

            <p class="subtitle">Exploring the Strong Password Regex Pattern</p>
            <article>This section introduces the regex pattern for strong passwords that you'll be
                dissecting throughout the
                tutorial. It prepares you for understanding the various components and criteria of the
                pattern.<span>In the following example of password regex pattern, you'll notice a combination of
                    letters, numbers, and special characters. I know it feels like hakuna matata stuff but don't worry
                    we will break it down.</span></article>
            <p class="examples">
                /^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\W)(?!.* ).{8,}$/
            </p>

            </article>

            <h2 id="section3">Analyzing Each Component</h2>
            <article>You'll delve into the specific requirements that define a strong password, such as
                length, character
                combination, and the inclusion of special characters. These criteria contribute to a more
                secure
                authentication process. Let's take a closer look at each of these components.
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2 id="section-a">Minimum Length Requirement</h2>
                To ensure the strength of passwords, a common practice is to set a minimum length requirement. This
                means that
                passwords must contain a certain number of characters to be considered strong. In the example pattern
                below,
                the <span class="modifier">{8,}</span> specifies that the password must be at least 8 characters long.
                <p class="examples">
                    /^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\W)(?!.* ).<span class="modifier">{8,}</span>$/
                </p>
                <p>In this case as you can see the highlighted part of the regex pattern is <code>.{8,}</code> which
                    means
                    that the password must be at least 8 characters long. If you want to set a maximum length for the
                    password, you can use <code>.{8,16}</code> which means that the password must be at least 8
                    characters
                    long and can't be longer than 16 characters.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2 id="section-b">Combination of Characters</h2>
                Strong passwords often require a combination of different character types, such as uppercase letters,
                lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. This diversity increases complexity and security. The
                example pattern below enforces a combination of these character types.
                <p class="examples">
                    /^(?=.*<span class="digit">[0-9]</span>)(?=.*<span class="lowercase">[a-z]</span>)(?=.*<span
                        class="uppercase">[A-Z]</span>)(?=.*\W)(?!.* ).{8,}$/
                </p>
                <p>and all these highlighted parts of the regex pattern are the conditions for the password which
                    combine all characters. The password
                    must contain at least one digit, one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and so on.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2 id="section-c">Including Special Characters</h2>
                Special characters like symbols and punctuation marks add an extra layer of security to passwords. These
                characters are often harder to guess and can thwart various hacking attempts. The example pattern below
                ensures the inclusion of at least one special character.
                <p class="examples">
                    /^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*<span class="special-char">\W</span>)(?!.* ).{8,}$/
                </p>
                <p>here <strong>\W</strong> refers to any non-word character. It matches any character that is not a
                    word character from the basic Latin alphabet. Equivalent to <code>[^A-Za-z0-9_]</code>. which means
                    that the password must contain at least one special character.</p>
            </article>


            <h1 id="section4">Constructing the Complete Pattern</h1>
            <article> Now that you've explored the individual components of a strong password regex pattern, it's time
                to put
                them
                all together. The following complete pattern combines the criteria for a strong password, including
                minimum
                length, a variety of character types, and the presence of special characters. This pattern can be used
                to
                validate strong passwords.
                <p class="examples">
                    /^(?=.*<span class="digit">[0-9]</span>)(?=.*<span class="lowercase">[a-z]</span>)(?=.*<span
                        class="uppercase">[A-Z]</span>)(?=.*<span class="special-char">\W</span>)(?!.* ).<span
                        class="modifier">{8,16}</span>$/
                </p>
                <p>And now we have a complete regex pattern for strong passwords. This pattern can be used to validate
                    strong passwords.</p>
            </article>


            <h1 id="section5">Application in Real Projects</h1>
            <article>Understanding regex patterns for strong passwords is essential for enhancing security in various
                applications.
                Whether you're developing a registration form, user account system, or any other scenario requiring
                secure
                password creation, applying this regex pattern can greatly improve the resilience of your system against
                common password-related vulnerabilities.

                <h2>Real-World Example of Strong Password Regex Pattern</h2>
                <p>Let's explore a real-world example of a strong password regex pattern used in an application:</p>
                <span>Consider the following JavaScript code snippet:</span><br>

                <div class="code-example">

                        } <span style="color: #e91e63;">else</span> {<br>
                            <span style="color: #3f51b5;">// Display an error message if the password is invalid</span>
                            <span style="color: #673ab7;">document</span>.<span style="color: #6200ea;">getElementById</span>('validationResult').<span style="color: #6200ea;">textContent</span> = <span style="color: #a10000;">'Password is invalid!'</span>;<br>

            <h1 id="section7">Summary</h1>

            <p>I want to remind you of some basic rules of regex patterns before I summarize this article.</p>
            <p><strong>Be careful with these rules:</strong></p>
            <div class="summary-message">
                <ol>
                    <li><strong> indicate '^' at the beginning of the string. indicate '$' at the end of
                            the string.</strong>
                        If we don't use these ^ & $, the regex will not be able to determine the maximum length of the
                        password.
                        In the above example, we have a condition that the password can't be longer than 16 characters.
                        To
                        make
                        that condition work, we have used these ^ & $.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remove maximum length restriction:</strong> Instead of <code>.{8,16}</code>, if we used
                        <code>.{8,}</code>,
                        it would mean that the password must be at least 8 characters long. So, there will not be any
                        condition for
                        checking the maximum length of the password.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Don't accept any number (digit):</strong> Instead of <code>(?=.*[0-9])</code>, if we
                        used
                        <code>(?!.*[0-9])</code>,
                        it would mean that the password must not contain any digit from 0 to 9 (Difference with the
                        <code>(?=.*[0-9])</code> is
                        the use of <code>!</code> instead of <code>=</code>).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Don't accept any special character:</strong> Instead of <code>(?=.*\W)</code>, if we
